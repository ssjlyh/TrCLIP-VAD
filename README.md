# TrCLIP-VAD: Weak supervised video anomaly detection by improving CLIP training with text rewriting
# :rocket: Motivation
![alt text](https://github.com/ssjlyh/TrCLIP-VAD/blob/main/data/framework.png)
The overview of the proposed TrCLIP-VAD. It consists of several components, i.e. visual branch, text branch, C-branch (coarse-grained branch) and F-branch (fine-grained branch).
# :calendar: TODO

During the submission phase, we have disclosed partial core algorithms of training and testing (trainText.zip and testText.zip) were automatically generated.

Welcome to watch :eyes: this repository for the latest updates.

- [x] [2025.4.15]: The textual data generated by LLMs.
- [x] [2025.4.20]: We have released the core code for part of the model.
- [ ] The complete model code.
- [ ] Training and inference code released.
